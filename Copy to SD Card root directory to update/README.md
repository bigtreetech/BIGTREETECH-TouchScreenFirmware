- the **.bin** file is the firmware of BIGTREETECH TFT24, this file needs to be updated every time for update function
- the **TFT24** folder contains the icons and fonts, if you want to customize them, see [here](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-TouchScreenFirmware/tree/master/readme/English) and update the folder by SD Card
  - icons: BMP format, 24/32 bit depth  (don't need update every time)
  - fonts: this is a bitmap fonts of ASCII and unicode. (don't need update every time)
